# computer-vision
Store some of the implementation that about Computer Vision.<br>
Now including: ViBe.<br>
Add a new coursework about Image Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks - ImageNet10<br>
## Motivation
• Use convolutional neural networks, from development to training and testing; <br>
• Gain a deeper understanding of feature maps and filters and their evolution and function <br>
during the training process and testing;<br>
• Explore methods of improving performance on a network.<br>
